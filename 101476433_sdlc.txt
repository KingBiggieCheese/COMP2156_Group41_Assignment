The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a structured process used by software development
teams to design, develop, test, and deploy high-quality software. DevOps plays a critical role
in modernizing and optimizing the SDLC by integrating development and operations teams, automating
workflows, and enabling continuous delivery.
1. **Planning and Requirements Analysis:**
   - DevOps encourages collaboration between developers, operations, and stakeholders early in the planning phase.
   - Tools like Jira and Trello help track requirements and ensure alignment between teams.
2. **Design:**
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and Ansible allow teams to design scalable and reproducible infrastructure.
   - DevOps practices ensure that system architecture is designed with automation and scalability in mind.
